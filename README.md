TFTP-PXE-Boot-Server
====================

This project contains the basic files and folder setup needed for a TFTP PXELINUX server.

It currently has support for network (PXE) installing:

* Centos 6.x
* Centos 7.0
* Fedora 24
* Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)

To use it, you need to

1. Set up a TFTP server. If you are using a Mac you could use this one - http://ww2.unime.it/flr/tftpserver/
2. Checkout this project code on the TFTP server, and ensure the tftp root points at this project folder.
  ```git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:paulmaunders/TFTP-PXE-Boot-Server.git .```
3. Setup your DHCP to point at the TFTP server (using DHCP option 66 "next-server" if located on a different IP to the DHCP server)
4. Setup your DHCP to offer the PXELINUX.0 as the boot filename (DHCP option 67).
5. Edit the pxelinux.cfg/default file to add in your PXE boot options. I've included CentOS examples.
